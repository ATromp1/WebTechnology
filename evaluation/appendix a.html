          <td>Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.</td>
          <td>Semantic markdown is used for almost everything, making programmatically determining the context of the page possible so it can present this information to users in different modalities however, some ARIA landmarks could be added to differentiate different regions of the page.</td>

          <td>When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.</td>
          <td>Meets the requirement: since the visual presentation of the sections does not match the programmatically determined order, but the meaning of the page does not depend on the order of the sections.</td>

          <td>1.3.3</td>
          <td>Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.</td>

          <td>If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.</td>
          <td>Meets the requirement: Tab can be used to navigate the page, including the form used for the table, resulting in no keyboard traps.</td>

          <td>If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.</td>
