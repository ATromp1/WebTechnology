    <h1>Self-Evaluation Report</h1>
    <h2>Date of Evaluation: 28/01/2020</h2>
    <h2>Rico van Leeuwen & Alexander Tromp</h2>
    <h2>Group 8 LabCS-1</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This website is accessible for people with low vision, since the site has screenreader capabilities trough ARIA landmarks. It also supports the exclusive use of a keyboard, using the tab key to navigate the page,
         making the page useable for 
        people with a motor dysfunction. Furthermore, the page does not make use of any audio cues nor conveys any information through color, shape or locations, making it accessible for colorbind and deaf people.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility highlights</h3>
    <p>The accessibility highlights we deem the most important for our page are: being able to navigate the page
        exclusively by keyboard (2.1.1), and to have information conveyed through presentation
        to be programmically determined/available in text (1.3.1). This would greatly benefit people who cannot use the
        mouse to still access the page, and allows people with limited eyesight to make use of a screenreader which
        can interpret the page text.
    </p>
